# Rails form application skeleton

This is supposed to be a starting point for a gov.uk form-based
application, using the software patterns developed for the
[Appeal to the Tax Tribunal][taxtribs] application.

Most of the code which was specific to that service has been
removed, however there are some leftover strings which will
need to be searched for and replaced, once the name of the new
service and its core data model have been chosen. These include:

* tribunal_case
* TribunalCase
* TaxTribs
* tax_tribs
* TaxTribunalsDatacapture
* Appeal to the tax tribunal

Some of these may also be present as file or directory names.
